<h1>Another Letter.</h1>

<p>
	Do you remember the first time we met?<br>
	When I said that I knew you, from way back?<br>
	<br>
	I'm glad I met you again.<br>
	I don't know why you were so important to me in the past, but I know that right now, <br>
	<br>
	You still are.<br>
	<br>
	So thanks, I guess.<br>
	For everything.
