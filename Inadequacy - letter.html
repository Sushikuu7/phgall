<h1>Inadequacy.</h1>

<p>
	Inadequacy is a disease.
	<br>
	One cured with flashing lights, dim spaces, broken dreams, fancy colors, and messy rooms.
	<br>
	Imaginations running wild, of places far away, people you’ve never known. Dreaming in incredible worlds, universes that never existed.
	<br>
	A soft warmth illuminating your arm. The  soft flow of hair through your fingers. A gentle breath you can’t hear.
	<br>
	A heartbeat that never existed.
	<br>
	<br>
	Glance at the numbers. It’s time to go. Maybe you’ll find satisfaction in the words.
	<br>
	<br>
	I don’t.
	<br>
	<br>
	Perhaps I am inadequate. I look down on others. A disguise.
	<br>
	But in the end
	<br>
	We are all victims of time.
	<br>
	<br>
	And maybe today I’ll never be as good as someone’s yesterday. But that’s okay.
	<br>
	At least I was myself.
