<h1>Self-Awareness.</h1>

<p>
	I say “despite” too much.
	<br>
	Hypocritical as such.
	<br>
	Rhymes bore the audience
	<br>
	Overdone
	<br>
	overdone.
	<br>
	Yet here I stand, typing away
	<br>
	as hypocritical as the land
	<br>
	rhyming as I may.
	<br>
	Nothing really matters, if I am to be true.
	<br>
	We all die someday.
	<br>
	<br>
	There’s no point in writing this, whatever it may be
	<br>
	No intricate flow, no special verse
	<br>
	No deeper meaning, just honest words.
	<br>
	Because I write not to entertain
	<br>
	but to satisfy my losses
	<br>
	to hide away the pain.
